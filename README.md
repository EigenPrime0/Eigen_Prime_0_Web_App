Welcome to the Eigen Prime 0 web application development project! This project aims to create a web-based application for Eigen Prime 0, a sophisticated numerical computing platform.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
eigen-prime-0-web-app/
├── frontend/          # Frontend code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
├── backend/           # Backend code (Server-side logic)
└── README.md          # Project documentation
```

- **frontend/**: Contains the frontend code for the web application, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- **backend/**: Contains the backend code for the web application, implemented using Python and a backend framework such as Django or Flask.
- **README.md**: This documentation file providing an overview of the project structure and setup instructions.

## Technologies

The following technologies are used for developing the web-based application:

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML: Markup language for creating web pages.
  - CSS: Styling language for designing web page layouts and appearance.
  - JavaScript: Programming language for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.

- **Backend:**
  - Python: A versatile programming language used for backend development.
  - Django or Flask: Python web frameworks for building web applications.

- **Database:**
  - Choose a database system for storing user data and application information, such as SQLite (for development), PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB.

## Development Tools

The following tools are recommended for developing the web application:

- Code Editors: Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom for writing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python code.
- Version Control: Git for managing project code and collaborating with team members.
- Browser Developer Tools: Chrome DevTools, Firefox Developer Tools, etc., for debugging and inspecting web pages.
- Terminal or Command Line Interface (CLI): Command-line tools for running development servers, executing scripts, and managing project dependencies.
